# dead_technology
stuff that no one should use anymore

# Wifi technology

    WAP - Broken, do not use

    WPA - Broken, do not use (compare WPA2)

    WPA2 - Early versions are broken, use latest version only or upgrade to WPA3

# Symmetric Key Algorithms

    DES (Data Encryption Standard) - Considered completely insecure and should be avoided 4

    3DES (Triple DES) - Still used in some legacy systems, but considered legacy and should be phased out 4

# Public Key Algorithms

    RSA-768, RSA-1024 - Key sizes below 2048 bits are considered weak and should be avoided 4

    DSA-768, DSA-1024 - Similar to RSA, key sizes below 2048 bits are weak 4

    Diffie-Hellman groups < 2048 bits - Groups smaller than 2048 bits are considered insecure 4

# Hash Functions

    MD5 - Completely broken and should never be used 4

    SHA-1 - Considered legacy and should be phased out 4

# Other Deprecated Algorithms

    RC4 - Stream cipher that is vulnerable to attacks and should be avoided 4

    CBC mode with AES - While AES itself is strong, CBC mode is considered legacy 4
